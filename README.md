## Columns sorting using react-table.

###  To run locally:

1/pull code,
2/`npm install`
3/`npm start`

4/ Once it is running make sure to enter the right params such as:

http://localhost:3000/city/ascd
http://localhost:3000/country/desc

The first url param will select the columns that needs to be sorted.
The name of the first params  can be: empty, all, structure, city, country, telecom, hundre, hundredFifty, twoHundred, treeHundred
The second will make is ascdending or descending.

### It took me about this time to do it:

Started 12:45
Finished: 12: 51

and then an extra 10min to writte the read me.

###  What I could improve:

- Naming of my constant and files
- Have a default page that display the table without sorting
- Style: The objective was to make the table logic work so no style was done.
- file structure
- I decided for my sorting to be as as such: element numbers, alphabetical order and then numerical order. There could be a better sorting logic.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
